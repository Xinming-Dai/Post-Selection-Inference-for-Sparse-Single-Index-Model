# Post-Selection-Inference-for-Sparse-Single-Index-Model

In this note, we propose a post-selection inference method for single-index models. Considering the unknown link function, our analysis provides confidence intervals for parameters by constructing pivot quantity. Furthermore, both theoretical explanations and simulations are presented to demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.
